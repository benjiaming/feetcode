Todo App with a basic functionality:
1. Add new tasks on clicking the "Submit" button.
2. The `<input>` field should be cleared upon successful addition.
3. Remove tasks from the Todo List upon clicking the "Delete" button.

Note: The focus of this question is on functionality, not the styling.

Run: `npx vite src/react/todo/`
