The form should contain the following elements:
* Name field.
* Email field.
* Message field. Since the message can be long, a `<textarea>` will be more suitable.
* Submit button
* Contains the text "Send".
* Clicking on the submit button submits the form.

The form and submission should be implemented entirely in HTML. Do not use any JavaScript or framework-specific features for this question.

Run: `npx vite src/react/contact-list`
